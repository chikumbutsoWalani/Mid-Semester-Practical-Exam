- Spend most time on server setup and functionality
- Don't spend too much time on visual perfection
- Leave buffer time for testing and debugging
- Make regular commits to protect your work

### **Technical Tips**
- Use `console.log()` for debugging server-side code
- Use browser developer tools for client-side debugging
- Test your application in different browsers
- Verify responsive design using browser dev tools
- Keep your code clean and well-organized
